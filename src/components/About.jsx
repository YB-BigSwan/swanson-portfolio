          Hi, I’m Stephen! A third year Business Information Technology student
          at Haaga-Helia UAS. I major in Software
          <br /> Development and minor in Digital Service Design. As I near
          graduation, I am on the lookout for internships or junior <br />
          roles to kickstart my career. Beyond that, my goal is to learn new
          things every day and continue challenging myself to grow as I believe
          personal growth never stops.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into software development began when I was preparing to
          move to Finland. I was already looking to change careers when a friend
          asked if I knew anything about programming and if I could try to make
          him something using JUCE, a C++ framework for making audio plug-ins. I
          figured I had nothing to lose and said yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the task was too much for me to take on at the time, I felt a
          spark. Software development was a field where I could fulfill both my
          desire to challenge my problem solving skills and also have some
          creative expression. Embracing that challenge, and noting that audio
          plug-in development was rather niche, I enrolled at Haaga-Helia
          seeking something more practical. Since then, I have discovered a deep
          satisfaction in the continuous learning environment that is web and
          software development.
        </p>

          My coding philosophy revolves around keeping things clean, writing
          self-documenting code, and maintaining a perpetual learning mindset.
